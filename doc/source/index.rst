HanziAnalysisKit
=================================

``HanziAnalysisKit`` introduces two advanced linguistic tools for Chinese text analysis:

-  The ``HGCT (Hanzi Glyph Corpus Toolkit)`` facilitates the building, reading, and detailed analysis of Chinese text corpora, with functionalities for concordance searches, frequency distribution, dispersion analysis, and more. 
-  ``lexicoR`` offers similar capabilities within an R programming environment, targeting users needing to access Chinese lexical resources through R. 

Both tools are designed for researchers and developers focused on computational linguistics and the structural analysis of the Chinese language.
