HanziAnalysisKit
=================================

``HanziAnalysisKit`` introduces two advanced linguistic tools for Chinese text analysis:

-  The ``HGCT (Hanzi Glyph Corpus Toolkit)`` facilitates the building, reading, and detailed analysis of Chinese text corpora, with functionalities for concordance searches, frequency distribution, dispersion analysis, and more. 
-  The ``lexicoR`` package provides an R interface for accessing Chinese lexical resources, allowing users to query databases like Chinese Wordnet, DeepLex, and the Chinese Lexical Database. Users can conduct concordance searches, analyze frequency distributions, and explore word senses and relations.

Both tools are designed for researchers and developers focused on computational linguistics and the structural analysis of the Chinese language.
